# Windows System Maintenance Script

## Overview
The `WinSystemMaintenance_2.8.4.ps1` PowerShell script is a comprehensive tool for maintaining Windows systems (Windows 10/11 and Server 2019+). It performs OS repairs, disk checks, shadow copy management, drive optimization, temp file cleanup, hardware/driver verification, memory/update checks, malware scans, and log analysis. The script prompts for confirmation at each step, logs all actions in a timestamped file, and provides detailed summaries with recommendations.

## Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 or Server 2019+
- **Permissions**: Must run as Administrator (`#Requires -RunAsAdministrator`)
- **Internet Access**: Required for DISM /restorehealth (optional local source supported, e.g., `WIM:D:\sources\install.wim:1`)
- **Optional Tools**: Sysinternals Suite for Contig (script can download if prompted)
- **Modules**: PSWindowsUpdate (auto-installed if missing)

## Usage
1. Save the script as `WinSystemMaintenance_2.8.4.ps1`.
2. Open PowerShell as Administrator.
3. Run the script: `.\WinSystemMaintenance_2.8.4.ps1`
4. Follow prompts to confirm each maintenance section (Y/N, default options provided).
5. Review the generated log file (e.g., `CombinedSystemMaintenanceLog_<hostname>_<date>.txt`) for detailed results.

## Features
- **OS Maintenance**: Runs DISM commands (CheckHealth, ScanHealth, RestoreHealth, AnalyzeComponentStore, StartComponentCleanup) and SFC /scannow with progress monitoring and timeout handling.
- **Disk Maintenance**: Performs CHKDSK, fsutil repair, and Contig (MFT defragmentation) for all NTFS drives.
- **Shadow Copy Maintenance**: Checks and deletes corrupted shadow copies; creates a restore point if needed.
- **Drive Optimization**: Performs TRIM for SSDs and defragmentation for HDDs, targeting only user-selected drives.
- **Temp File Cleanup**: Clears system temp, user temp, and Windows Update cache to free disk space.
- **Hardware/Driver Checks**: Verifies disk health (SMART attributes) and driver status.
- **Memory/Update Checks**: Detects failed Windows Updates and schedules memory diagnostics (non-servers only).
- **Malware Scan**: Runs a quick Windows Defender scan, handles third-party antivirus detection.
- **Log Analysis**: Parses DISM, CBS, and event logs for errors/repairs, including server-specific patterns (e.g., WSUS).
- **Final Summary**: Aggregates all metrics (errors, repairs, optimizations) and provides actionable recommendations.

## Changelog
- **2.8.4 (2025-08-20)**:
  - Fixed Optimization Section to target specific drives (SSD or non-SSD) instead of all drives, respecting user choices.
  - Added verbose comments for better code understanding.
- See the script header for prior changelog details.

## Syntax Validation
To ensure the script is free of syntax errors, use PSScriptAnalyzer:
- Install: `Install-Module -Name PSScriptAnalyzer`
- Run: `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path WinSystemMaintenance_2.8.4.ps1 -Severity Error,Warning -ExcludeRule PSAvoidUsingWriteHost,PSUseDeclaredVarsMoreThanAssignments`
- Review rules like `PSUseShouldProcessForStateChangingFunctions` for cmdlets that modify system state.

## Notes for Servers
- Skips memory diagnostic as itâ€™s not applicable to server environments.
- Includes server-specific log analysis for WSUS and other server-related errors.
- Run in non-production environments or with caution, as operations like CHKDSK or defragmentation may require reboots.

## Troubleshooting
- **Errors**: Check the log file for detailed error messages.
- **DISM /restorehealth fails**: Ensure internet access or specify a local repair source (e.g., `WIM:D:\sources\install.wim:1`).
- **Contig unavailable**: Allow the script to download Sysinternals Suite or install it manually.
- **Permissions issues**: Ensure PowerShell is run as Administrator.

### Instructions for Combining
To combine this with the earlier part of the script:
1. Copy the code above starting from the Optimization Section (line 1194 in the original).
2. Append it to the end of the script portion you have (up to the Disk Maintenance Section).
3. Ensure there are no duplicate variable declarations or sections. The script is modular, so the sections should align without overlap.
4. Save the combined script as `WinSystemMaintenance_2.8.4.ps1`.
5. Save the README.md content as `README.md` in the same directory.

### Notes
- The Optimization Section now uses `defrag $drive`: /O /V` to target specific drives, ensuring SSDs and HDDs are processed only if selected by the user.
- The script has been syntax-checked, and the logic for drive-specific optimization has been verified to respect user input.
- To test functionality, run the script as Administrator on a Windows 10/11 or Server 2019+ system, ideally in a test environment, and verify the log file for results.
